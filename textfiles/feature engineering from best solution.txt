the best solution found that these feature engineering could help our model:

- boost by label encoding for categorical variables

- created aggregates of the previous_application:
we should try aggregates for last three and first two applications

- transform region_id_population from numerical to categorical

- create credit_annuity_ratio
amt_credit / amt_annuity

this should be a good start for feature engineering
